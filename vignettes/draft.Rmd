# Introduction

"Benchmarks as Limits to Arbitrage: Understanding the Low Volatility Anomaly" by Baker, Bradley and Wurgler (2011)^[http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jwurgler/papers/faj-benchmarks.pdf] is an important paper in the literature on low volatility investing. I replicate the main results of this paper using data for large capitalization US stocks from 1998 through 2007.
